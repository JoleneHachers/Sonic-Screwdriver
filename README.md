Complete novice needs help with sketches for NeoPixel and Adafruit feather and eventually a sound card. EDUCATE ME!

I am getting nowhere and fell like I will never get there I need help.

I reverse engineer everything.
Something needs to work before I can understand it
I pull it apart and put it back together and only at that point am I master and commander.

This has not been the case with learning how to write code.

What I am after is ...for now..

Is a momentary push button
Connected to a 8 way selector switch (lets just use two for now)
Which will then go to the processor
Then depending on what is dialled on the selector switch (1 of 8)
On pushing and holding the momentary push button a sequence will start on the neopixel stick
On removing pressure of the momentary push button switch the sequence will stop
And on pushing again it will resume at the start of the sequence.

The hardware I have is a AdaFruit Feather
And a 8 led NEO Pixel stick

If you could knock me up a script 

That will say for example

Pins 1 & 2 connected to selector switch
Pin 6 connected to NeoPixel

When pin 1 goes high
Pin 6 will do a fancy sequence
When pin goes low
Sequence stops

When pin 2 goes high
Pin (6?) will do a fancy sequence
When pin 2 logs low
Sequence stops

And the most important thing is to comment the hell out of it to help me understand what is going on. And how to expand it by adding more fancy LED sequences to the script.


Please let me know


I look forward to hearing from you


Kind regards
