# Sonic-Screwdriver
Complete novice needs help with sketches for NeoPixel and Adafruit feather and eventually a sound card. EDUCATE ME!

I reverse engineer everything.
Something needs to work before I can understand it
I pull it apart and put it back together and only at that point am I master and commander.

This has not been the case with learning how to write code.

What I aim to build is a sonic screwdriver with the following functions

Is a momentary push button
Connected to a 8 way selector switch (lets just use two for now)
Which will then go to the processor
Then depending on what is dialled on the selector switch (1 of 8)
On pushing and holding the momentary push button a sequence will start on the neopixel stick
On removing pressure of the momentary push button switch the sequence will stop
And on pushing again it will resume at the start of the sequence.

The hardware I have is a AdaFruit Feather
And a 8 led NEO Pixel stick
and will slowley introduce a music maker for .mp3 sound 

What is github
its been handy for sucking of my data inbetween two diffrent PCs but I don't see what Im playing for, its nothing a flash stick can't do for me
